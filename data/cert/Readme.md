About this data
===============

The CERT Division, in partnership with ExactData, LLC, and under sponsorship from DARPA I2O, generated a collection of synthetic insider threat test datasets. These datasets provide both synthetic background data and data from synthetic malicious actors.

For more background on this data, please see the paper, *Bridging the Gap: A Pragmatic Approach to Generating Insider Threat Data*.

Datasets are organized according to the data generator release that created them. Most releases include multiple datasets (e.g., `r3.1` and `r3.2`). Generally, later releases include a superset of the data generation functionality of earlier releases. Each dataset file contains a readme file that provides detailed notes about the features of that release.

The answer key file `answers.tar.bz2` contains the details of the malicious activity included in each dataset, including descriptions of the scenarios enacted and the identifiers of the synthetic users involved.
